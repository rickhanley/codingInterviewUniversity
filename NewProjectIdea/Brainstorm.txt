What problems can I identify?
    Shopping
        Time consuming
        difficult to know exactly what you have in already
        The need to copy ingredients lists into website is a chore


Shopping app

What would make it useful?
    The ability to enter meals from a database of online recipes
    Have it collate the ingredients and check for duplicates / waste
    Know what you have in already and remaining quantities

Project management app

What would make it useful?
    The process is opaque - the app needs to know what needs to happen and when by
    It can provide prompts and due database
    It can give ready access to key documents rather that using network drives
