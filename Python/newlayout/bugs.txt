if you click complete and then hit the filter button
the list that is rendered is  on the first click. If you
toggle twice more, they appear. When the Toggle button is clicked
it needs to commit to the database and then pull the latest data.

The filter button seesm to be doing a refresh on the intial click

filter_type_toggle in sort state could be useful for resolving
the issues about the views and what should be the current view for renderlist
Renderlist is called a lot and defaults back to non complete tasks which isn't always 
needed
